# New Model Implementation

To add a new model implementation, you can use the command :

```sh
cargo burn-lm new {model_name}
```

This will create a new crate and register it in the model registry.

## Project Structure

For the project structure, you can draw inspiration from the `burn-lm-llama` crate. The
implementations are still evolving rapidly, so detailed documentation may not keep pace with the
code changes.
