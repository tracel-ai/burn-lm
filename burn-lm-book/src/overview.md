The **BurnLM Book** should serve as a comprehensive resource for using, modifying, and contributing
to the `burn-lm` repository.

Currently, `burn-lm` is primarily an application. However, we should extend its usage to facilitate
embedding models in other applications, exposing a library rather than limiting it to a standalone
binary.

The book should also include clear documentation on how to contribute and implement new models in
the repository.

## Scope Guidelines

Following best practices of app development, `burn-lm` should be self-documented.
CLI documentation should not be included in the book, as the CLI itself should provide executable
documentation (e.g., through help commands)
